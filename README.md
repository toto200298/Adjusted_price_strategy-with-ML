### Adjusted Price Strategy <a name="adjusted_strategy">

An adjusted pricing strategy is a dynamic approach to setting the advertised price of products or services, which considers various factors such as market conditions, competitor strategies, customer preferences, and economic indicators.  

The primary objective is twofold: to boost profitability and market share by establishing prices that are perceived as fair and competitive, while aligning with the company's goals. This strategy entails continuously adapting prices based on the probability of making a sale, aiming to strike a delicate balance between maximizing revenue and ensuring a favorable likelihood of transaction completion.

Advantages of the Adjusted Price Strategy:
- **Maximized Profits**: By pricing products slightly above market value, the strategy enables the dealership to capture additional value on each sale.
- **High Likelihood of Selling**: Adjusting prices based on the probability of selling ensures that products remain appealing to potential buyers, resulting in increased sales volume.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Adjusted prices strike a balance between profitability and competitiveness, providing the dealership with an advantageous position in the market.
- **Adaptability**: The strategy is flexible and adaptable to changing market dynamics and customer preferences, allowing for responsive pricing decisions.
